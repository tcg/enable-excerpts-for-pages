Adds the 'Excerpt' field to the Page edit screen, just like the one available for Posts. Fully compatible with themes that utilize that feature.

== Description ==
The *Enable Excerpts for Pages* adds the 'Excerpt' field to the Page edit screen, just like the one available for Posts. Uses official WordPress API's, so is fully compatible with any themes that utilize that feature.

It uses the WordPress 'post type support' API to add the built-in 'excerpt' feature to Post edit pages. This also enables templates to use the WordPress function [`the_excerpt()`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_excerpt) to retrieve the excerpt for display.


== Installation ==
1. Upload `enable-excerpts-for-pages.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or use the "Add New" Plugin search/install feature built into WordPress.
2. Activate the Enable Excerpt for Pages plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Edit a Page. You should now see the "excerpt" section that you usually see when editing Posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Why are there so many downloads, but so few reviews?**

I'm not sure. I see that happen quite a lot. Would you please rate/review this plugin?

**I enabled the plugin, but I still don't see the Excerpt field! Where is it?**

Viewing the screenshots that came with this plugin might help, here. When on a Page edit screen, find the "Screen Options" menu (usually near the top right of the page). When you open that, you should now see a checkbox option for "Excerpt". *Check that box!*

You should now see the Excerpt editor available below the main content editor.

**Where can I get support?**
Try the official WordPress support forum for this plugin at http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/enable-excerpts-for-pages

While I will do my best to honor inquiries about this plugin, I did not release it with the intent to support it indefinitely. This plugin is to be used at the user's own risk. I may not always be able to respond to inquiries or continue updating the plugin on a regular basis, but there are many fine folks here in the WordPress community that should be able to help you out.

**What's up with your donate link?**
If you want to send money to *me*, just get in touch via the forums or twitter, etc. Otherwise, if you're in the giving mood, I'd love if you donated to one of the organizations I enjoy supporting. As I develop WordPress plugins, I tend to put the URLs of those organizations in the "donate URL" section, rather than a link to my own site.

== Screenshots ==
1. "Before" activation, or before the Screen Options have been changed.
2. "After" activation; might still need to enable Excerpts from the "Screen Options" menu.
3. "Excerpts" editor now visible below Page content editor!
