Enable Excerpts for Pages
=========================

WordPress plugin: Adds the 'Excerpt' field to the Page edit screen, just like the one available for Posts. Fully compatible with themes that utilize that feature.

This Github repo is for official development. Unfortunately, still mixing some SVN with my Git, because SVN is what the official WordPress repo uses. 

See the `readme.txt` file (formatted for the WordPress repo) for plugin documentation/details.
